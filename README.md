# YouLearn
YouLearn is an application for learning languages on iOS. It is absolutely NOT fully done yet so some bugs may be happening or some features may not work. Itâ€™s open source as a Swift-package. I mainly create it for people to learn Chinese but I made it open-source to make everyone get access to the source (swift package).
